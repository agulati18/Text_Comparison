#Background 
Statistical models are one way to quantify how similar one piece of text is to another. Such models were used as evidence that the book The Cuckoo's Calling was 
written by J. K. Rowling (using the name Robert Galbraith) in the summer of 2013. Details on that story and the analysis done appear at this link.

#Model 
The comparative analysis of those works used simple models—perhaps surprisingly simple—of an "author's style," for example, the distribution of word lengths in a document.
The five "text features" I implement for this project are:

The distribution of words used by an author.
The distribution of word lengths (noted above).
The distribution of word stems used (e.g., "spam" and "spamming" would have the same stem).
The distribution of sentence lengths used.
The distribution of punctuation used. 

#Result 
Text_Comparison
A statistical model that seeks to quantify how similar one piece of text is to another
